     <h1>Are you curious to know if you are indeed a human?</h1>
     <h3>Then you have come to the right place!</h3>
     <p> With that IQ of yours, anyone could mistake you for a cow, a sloth or even a potato. 
        It is completely normal! And it is also why we are here. 
        
        Based on your answers and preference, we shall figure out if you are a human.  </p>
    <h3> There are simple rules to this. </h3>
    <p> Idea:<br> Each “human” answer adds 1 point.(The human-ness of your answer is based on my judgment.)
  <br>Final score decides the result.
